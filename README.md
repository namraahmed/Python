# Random Forest
I tried to use the sklearn implementation of the DecisionTreeClassifier and then used those trees to build my Random Forest!   I Fit a Decision Tree model using the training data and then let the tree grow fully. Used the model to predict labels for both training data and test data and then reported training accuracy and test accuracy.  Next I used cross validation and loop over maximum depths from two to ten inclusive.



1) Used sklearn implementation of the DecisionTreeClassifier to build Random Forest
2) Data fit
3) Predict
4) Cross Validation
